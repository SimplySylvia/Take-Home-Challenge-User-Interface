# Box-to-Box Drag and Drop
Create two large squares on the screen and fill one of them with
smaller squares. The design, color, and layout is completely up to
you, but make sure that each small square is uniquely identifiable
using text, color, etc.

## Requirements:
- Any small box dragged and dropped over another small box should swap
positions with the other small box
- Any small box dragged and dropped on the other large square should
be moved to that square and swapped with any small box already there
- There should be a button that allows the user to reset the small box
positions
- There should be a button that allows the user to randomize the
layout and positioning of the small boxes within both large squares

The final project needs to work in the latest stable versions of
Chrome and Safari. Once completed, compress all files into a zip
archive and send it back.
